# norwegianBandPlan
Norwegian band plan for use with SharpSDR

## Usage
You can use the export feature from the official norwegian [frequency plan webpage](https://frekvens.nkom.no/#/main) to get the latest plan.

bandPlan.py can be used to convert the frequency plan .csv to SharpSDRs .xml format.

Just add BandPlan.xml to your SharpSDR install directory, overwriting the existing file.
(You may want to make a backup of the existing file)
